1- old communicator with 5deg -- this works
3 - old com with 10 deg -- doesnt work... i thought this should.. something wrong with 10 deg
4 old com with linear interp -  same as spline, doesnt work. I THINK THAT THE 10 DEG LIMITED MATRIX HAS ERRORS 
SEEMS TO HIT A MAXIMUM AT 34.5km
it does... at 0.03 rad trajectory angle

using 5 deg for now

5 const q new com
6 const q new com slow srarting point
-- doesnt work but gets close...


3 - new com with 5 deg third stage, starting from 1764m/s
this worked really well!!!
great news


need to remember that third stage is not currently taking into account inclination change

screen 2 in fist stage, which work, but hits -1 deg aoa for ages because it is the best to fly at



i think that the way Im doing the angle of attack limit is weird.


5 - new om starting at 1700m/s, for comparison with screen 3
this worked decently...

4 - new com starting at 1650, for comparison with 5 and 3

1 - monitoring times to see why its taking so long
I think its just DIDO

6 - 1650m/s start, 2700m./s end guess --didnt work

2- 1600m/s start 2700m/s end guess

3 - 1550m/s --this worked!

some of these closed...



24/01

2 constq - 1550m/s start, 2700m/s end guess
3 const 12 got close
4 const 13 ''

realised that liftforceinterp still had temp ratio included
not used though, so its ok
need to remove completely
done


disovered error in LiftError, restm12 was taking inputs of atmosphere and alt?? how did this work...
was just calling them that, wasnt actually that


fixed error in third stage, was using axial instead of normal coefficient





25/01
made new third stage matrix
at 38km payload starts decreasing, as this is where it hits 20 deg AoA

I need to see if its hitting 38km, 
running 50kPa limit screen 2
