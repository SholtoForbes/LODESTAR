1- old communicator with 5deg -- this works
3 - old com with 10 deg -- doesnt work... i thought this should.. something wrong with 10 deg
4 old com with linear interp -  same as spline, doesnt work. I THINK THAT THE 10 DEG LIMITED MATRIX HAS ERRORS 
SEEMS TO HIT A MAXIMUM AT 34.5km
it does... at 0.03 rad trajectory angle

using 5 deg for now

5 const q new com
6 const q new com slow srarting point
-- doesnt work but gets close...


3 - new com with 5 deg third stage, starting from 1764m/s
this worked really well!!!
great news


need to remember that third stage is not currently taking into account inclination change

screen 2 in fist stage, which work, but hits -1 deg aoa for ages because it is the best to fly at



i think that the way Im doing the angle of attack limit is weird.


5 - new om starting at 1700m/s, for comparison with screen 3

4 - new com starting at 1650, for comparison with 5 and 3

1 - monitoring times to see why its taking so long
I think its just DIDO
