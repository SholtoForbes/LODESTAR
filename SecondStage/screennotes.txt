1- old communicator with 5deg -- this works
3 - old com with 10 deg -- doesnt work... i thought this should.. something wrong with 10 deg
4 old com with linear interp -  same as spline, doesnt work. I THINK THAT THE 10 DEG LIMITED MATRIX HAS ERRORS 
SEEMS TO HIT A MAXIMUM AT 34.5km
it does... at 0.03 rad trajectory angle

using 5 deg for now

5 const q new com
6 const q new com slow srarting point
-- doesnt work but gets close...


3 - new com with 5 deg third stage, starting from 1764m/s
this worked really well!!!
great news


need to remember that third stage is not currently taking into account inclination change

screen 2 in fist stage, which work, but hits -1 deg aoa for ages because it is the best to fly at



i think that the way Im doing the angle of attack limit is weird.


5 - new om starting at 1700m/s, for comparison with screen 3
this worked decently...

4 - new com starting at 1650, for comparison with 5 and 3

1 - monitoring times to see why its taking so long
I think its just DIDO

6 - 1650m/s start, 2700m./s end guess --didnt work

2- 1600m/s start 2700m/s end guess

3 - 1550m/s --this worked!

some of these closed...



24/01

2 constq - 1550m/s start, 2700m/s end guess
3 const 12 got close
4 const 13 ''

realised that liftforceinterp still had temp ratio included
not used though, so its ok
need to remove completely
done


disovered error in LiftError, restm12 was taking inputs of atmosphere and alt?? how did this work...
was just calling them that, wasnt actually that


fixed error in third stage, was using axial instead of normal coefficient





25/01
made new third stage matrix
at 38km payload starts decreasing, as this is where it hits 20 deg AoA

I need to see if its hitting 38km, 
running 50kPa limit screen 2 -- doesnt work at all
trying 2800m/s guess
3 12 -- seems to work half decently... but forward sim is pretty off
	trying with 2800m/s vel guess
4 13  failed instantly...
	trying with 2800m/s vel guess

none of these worked

trying just const =1	2700m/s guess (i thought i used this, but looks like it was 2800)
screen
2	33km end guess
3 	32
4	35

all of these look like theyre moving in the right direction,  none are great though
also i think one didnt work, probably 35km
trying these again with 2700m./s end guess

35km guess tries to get there.. trying 34km guess
33km guess tries, but goes pretty weird

screen 2 const q with 1524 m/s start


screen 3- trying 33km guess with penalty *10  -- worked decently, not much of a pull up though, wobbles
screen 4 34km penalty*10  -- THIS NEARLY WORKED!!!!!!


screen 1 trying 35km with no omegadot 1*penalty -- finds a false maxime somehow... thats a little worrying
5 33km as above -- this worked best
6 31km -- wobbles, but kinda tries
screen 7 33.5km penaltyx10 -- didnt work



screen 1 - 33km no omegadot to verify
2 33.5
3 33km end, +100 q start alt
4 33km end -1000 q
5 2800m/s v guess
