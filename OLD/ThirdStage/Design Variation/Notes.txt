Variation in the design of the third stage.

Design parameters:

SPARTAN dependent:
Length
Width (Can change the nozzle with width and modify ISP)

SPARTAN Independent:
Thrust (remember to reduce ISP)
Cone angle
Mass (may be either fuel or payload mass changing)


These design changes need to be offset appropriately by:
Structural mass
Cost (wont do this, but may comment on it)
Payload capacity
