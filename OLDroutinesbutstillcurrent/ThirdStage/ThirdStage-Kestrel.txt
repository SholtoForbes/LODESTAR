Third Stage - Kestrel

Lnose = 3m, Centrebody = 4.5m, Engine = 2m. Note, some room has been left for the kestrel to go into the body slightly (about 0.5m)
This fits within the centrebody of the SPARTAN with a little room to spare. 

Area = 0.866

Total Mass = 3500kg - sized iteratively, any larger than this cannot sustain >0 trajectory angle

Engine Mass = 52kg

Heat Shield Mass = 125kG (phenolic cork body, C-C Cone and Tungsten nose)

mass flow rate = 9.8 kg/s

Isp = 317s (vacuum)

Exit Pressure, 1.4 kPa, calculated using Rocket Propulsion Analysis
